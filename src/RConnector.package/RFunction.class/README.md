A RLangageExpression is a language based list.  It is like a linked chain and the results can be evaluated.
Its type is LANGSXP under R.
A RLangageExpression as almost the same behaviour as a chained list under smallatalk.

You should use add* if you want to add sucessives elements to the list.

You should not create a langagelist too long else you cannot access the elements (I did't implement the sequencial accessors).
